# DMovr

A simple .NET Core console application to move files between directories.

## Overview

This program allows you to move files from one directory to another. It provides default paths or allows you to specify custom paths. If a custom path is not provided, it uses default paths.

## Features

-   **Default Paths**:
    -   Source: Current users desktop
    -   Destination: Current users desktop/movedItems
-   **Custom Paths**: Enter your own source and destination paths if needed.
-   **Error Handling**: Handles errors during directory creation and file moving.

## Notes
-   The default destination directory will be created if it does not exist already.
-   Currently does not support moving folders
